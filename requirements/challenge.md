# Proposed Flutter Challenge: Simple API Integration

## Overview

Create a Flutter application that fetches data from a public API and displays it on the screen.

### Steps

1. **Choose an API:** Select a public API that provides data you're interested in. Some popular options include:
   * OpenWeatherMap: For weather data
   * Random User Generator: For random user profiles
   * The Dog API: For random dog images

2. **Set up your Flutter project:** Create a new Flutter project using the `flutter create` command.

3. **Import necessary packages:** Import the `http` package for making HTTP requests.

4. **Create a stateful widget:** This widget will manage the state of the fetched data.

5. **Fetch data:**
   * Define a function to fetch data from the API using the `http` package.
   * Use `setState` to update the state with the fetched data.

6. **Display data:**
   * Use Flutter's widget tree to display the fetched data in a visually appealing way. You can use widgets like `Text`, `Image`, and `ListView` to present the information.

This challenge will help you practice using Flutter's core concepts, including state management, API integration, and UI development.
